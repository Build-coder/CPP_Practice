Cipher.h / Cipher.cpp

- This class is the parent class for each of the ciphers. 
- It holds a message (the piece of data that will be encrypted and decrypted)
- It also holds a bool indicating if the message is currently encrypted
- m_vars: string m_message, bool m_isEncrypted

CipherTool.h / CipherTool.cpp

- Longest and most complicated of the classes
- Manages the entire process
- Allows the user to display all ciphers
- Allows the user to encrypt / decrypt all ciphers
- Allows the user to export all ciphers
- Ciphers can be of different types 
- Ciphers are all stored in m_ciphers
- m_vars: vector<Cipher*> m_ciphers, string m_filename

Caesar.h / Caesar.cpp

- creates object (Caesar encrypted or decrypted) message
- m_shift: how many chars the cipher shifts the characters
- m_vars: int m_shift

Vigenere.h / Vigenere.cpp

- creates object (Vigenere encrypted or decrypted) message
- m_key: used to encrypt / decrypt

Ong.h / Ong.cpp

- creates object (Ong encrypted or decrypted) message

Plural Class: CipherTool.h / .cpp


Exporting using CipherTool

- ability for users to export ciphers to new file
- if desired, exported files can be imported and decrypted 
- must open, write to, and then close a file
- FormatOutput in each class formats a stringStream
- stringStream is returned as a single string
- must be done in subclass b/c m_vars are private

Sample Input / Output 

- Cipher Type: c = Cipher, v = Vigenere, o = Ong
- Delimiter: |

- input files have several parts:

- first part: indicates the cipher type 
- second part: indicates if message is encrypted or not
- third part: message itself
- fourth part: c: number of shifts, v: keyword, o: nada
